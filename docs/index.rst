astropy-timeseries preview documentation
****************************************

This is a **preview** of functionality under development for a new
**astropy.timeseries** sub-package. At the moment, you can try out this
functionality by installing the standalone package 'astropy_timeseries'::

    pip install git+https://github.com/aperiosoftware/astropy-timeseries.git

Note that this requires Astropy 3.1 or later (or the latest developer version).
