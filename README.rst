About
-----

This package contains an implementation of a timeseries sub-package for
the core astropy package. At the moment it provides an ``astropy_timeseries``
module that would later be replaced by ``astropy.timeseries``.

You can try out this functionality by installing the standalone package
'astropy_timeseries'::

    pip install git+https://github.com/aperiosoftware/astropy-timeseries.git

Note that this requires Astropy 3.1 or later (or the latest developer version).
You can also preview the documentation at
https://astropy-timeseries.readthedocs.io.

Please feel free to open issues here or even pull requests! Once this
functionality is ready to propose to the core astropy package, we plan to
preserve commits, so you will get credit for your contributions!
